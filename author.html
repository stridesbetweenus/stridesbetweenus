    <h1>About the Author</h1>

    <p>
      For more than thirty years, I worked advocating for injured workers.
      I sat across from people whose injuries never fully healed whose pain
      lingered long after decisions were made and files were closed. I saw what
      chronic pain can do when it isn’t just physical, but invisible. Confidence
      erodes. Relationships strain. Sometimes, entire lives quietly unravel.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, I’ve always been a runner.
      Not an elite one just committed. The kind who keeps showing up.
      Over the years, I’ve dealt with injuries, forced pauses, and the fear
      that comes when your body doesn’t respond the way it once did.
      Running has always been freedom for me, but it’s also taught me
      how fragile that freedom can be.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also a father.
      When my daughter was younger, we had our daddy–daughter days.
      Small things. Ordinary things. But anyone who’s lived that bond
      knows how deeply it shapes you and how long it stays with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then there’s Dolce, my whippet.
      Watching her run is watching motion without doubt.
      No overthinking. No hesitation. Just instinct and joy.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also spent many years involved in youth sports from coaching soccer to being part
      of the coaching group during my son’s minor hockey years. Those experiences
      taught me the significance of positive role models and how deeply coaches
      can impact the young people who trust them. The right coach doesn’t just
      teach a sport; they shape confidence, character, and resilience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere along the way, all of this converged.
    </p>

    <p>
      The injured workers.<br>
      The runner who keeps trying.<br>
      The father who understands how love anchors you.<br>
      The coach who has seen how mentorship changes young lives.<br>
      The dog who reminds me what unburdened motion truly looks like.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Strides Between Us</strong> grew out of that intersection.
    </p>

    <p>
      This story isn’t about winning races.
      It’s about what happens when motion is taken away
      and what it costs to find your way back.
