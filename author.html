        <p>
            For more than thirty years, I worked advocating for injured workers.
            I sat across from people whose injuries never fully healed whose pain lingered long after decisions were made and files were closed…
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, I’ve always been a runner. Not an elite one just committed. The kind who keeps showing up…
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m also a father. When my daughter was younger, we had our daddy–daughter days. Small things. Ordinary things…
        </p>

        <p>
            And then there’s Dolce, my whippet. Watching her run is watching motion without doubt…
        </p>

        <p>
            I also spent many years involved in youth sports, from soccer to being part of the coaching group during my son’s minor hockey years…
        </p>

        <p>
            Somewhere along the way, all of this converged.
        </p>

        <p>
            The injured workers.<br>
            The runner who keeps trying.<br>
            The father who understands how love anchors you.<br>
            The coach who has seen how mentorship changes young lives.<br>
            The dog who reminds me what unburdened motion truly looks like.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Strides Between Us</strong> grew out of that intersection.
        </p>

        <p>
            This story isn’t about winning races. It’s about what happens when motion is taken away and what it costs to find your way back.
