    <h2>About the Novel</h2>
    <p>
    Strides Between Us follows Jake, a promising young runner whose life collapses after a devastating injury
    during his senior year. Lost, isolated, and unable to cope, he drifts into years of homelessness, severed
    from the people who loved him most.
    </p>
    <p>
    Through memory, grief, and the quiet power of human connection, Jake slowly rebuilds himself, confronting
    the past he ran from and the mentor he failed to say goodbye to.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is a novel about resilience, identity, second chances, and the belief that even after losing everything,
    a person can still find their way back.
